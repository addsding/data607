## Overview
This data set includes information from two airlines: ALASKA and AM WEST. These two airlines have 6 destinations that they operate with and this data includes a count of flights that were on time and delayed for each of the 6 cities.

```{r preview}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addsding/data607/main/assignment5/data.csv")
head(data)
```

## Tidying the Data
Tidy data is data where:
- Every columns is variable
- Every row is an observation
- Every cell is a single value

We see that to start with, every row here contains two observations: `On Time` and `Delayed`. We first want to separate this into two rows in order to have clean data.
